Will-a-Customer-Accept-the-Coupon?
---
Overview:
In this first practical application assignment of the program, you will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not. Use the Practical Application Jupyter Notebook Links to an external site. to complete this assignment.

Data:
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

Conclusion:
--
In general, those drivers, who has the habit of going to bar more frequently are taking advantage of the coupon and accepting the same more compared to anyone else.
From the data, bar coupons acceptance ratio is 58% without any conditions. So, I think 58% is threshold instead of 50%. Hence, any ratio greater than 50% is "higher chance".
People who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 have a greater acceptance rate than those who go to bars more than once a month but are not children or widowed.
The acceptance rate of persons who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is higher than people who go to cheap restaurants more than four times a month and earn less than 50K.
People who go to cheap restaurants more than four times a month and earn less than 50K have a greater acceptance rate than those who go to bars more than once a month and are not children or widows.
Coffee coupons were accepted comparatively more by the passanger with friends group whereas comparatively less when travelling alone.
It is interesting to notice the young drivers with age below 21 has higher acceptance for coffee coupons, whereas elderly population with 50 plus shows slightly less acceptance but all other intermediate groups show around 50% acceptance.
For coffee coupons, drivers who is student and have passanger (but not kids) with them have really high chance to accept coffee house coupons.
While one can normally think the weather could play a role in coffee consumption, but it was not creating any impact in acceptance of coupons. Infact, the acceptance was slightly low when snowy, so the guess is the driving comfort could have influenced.
